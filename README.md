# Game Developer Portfolio

## About

I am an experienced developer who is trying to get into Game Development.

I have writen various corporate software for the likes of Bhs, Debenhams, Argos and Sainsburys. I have also written Warehouse Management Software for K3 and the C# backend software for Hoseasons. Then after contracting for CAM Systems, done work for the Managed Services team at Civica, looking after several websites for 'The Environmental Agency' and various other Central Government Departments.

I then changed track and developed several games using C# and Blazor before doing a 14 week Unity game development course with Tech Educators [https://techeducators.co.uk/course/unity-coding-bootcamp](https://techeducators.co.uk/course/unity-coding-bootcamp). It is this side of things I would like to pursue.
